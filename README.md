# jira-service-desk-operator
Kubernetes operator for Jira Service Desk

## About

Jira service desk(JSD) operator is used to automate the process of setting up JSD for alertmanager in a k8s native way. By using CRDs it lets you:

1. Manage Projects
2. Manage customer/organization for projects
3. Configure Issues

It uses [Jira REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/) in it's underlying layer and can be extended to perform other tasks that are supported via the REST API.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Atlassian account
- API Token to access Jira REST API (https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)

### Create secret

Create the following secret which is required for jira-service-desk-operator:

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: jira-service-desk-config
  namespace: default
data:
  JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_API_TOKEN: <API_TOKEN>
  #Example: https://stakater-cloud.atlassian.net/
  JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_API_BASE_URL: <JSD_BASE_URL>
  JIRA_SERVICE_DESK_EMAIL: <EMAIL>
type: Opaque
```

### Deploy operator

- Make sure that [certman](https://cert-manager.io/) is deployed in your cluster since webhooks require certman to generate valid certs since webhooks serve using HTTPS
- To install certman
```terminal
$ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.16.1/cert-manager.yaml
```
- Deploy operator
```terminal
$ oc apply -f bundle/manifests
```

## Local Development

[Operator-sdk v0.19.0](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/tag/v0.19.0) is required for local development.

1. Create `jira-service-desk-config` secret
2. Run `make run ENABLE_WEBHOOKS=false WATCH_NAMESPACE=default OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=default` where `WATCH_NAMESPACE` denotes the namespaces that the operator is supposed to watch and `OPERATOR_NAMESPACE` is the namespace in which it's supposed to be deployed.

3. Before committing your changes run the following to ensure that everything is verified and up-to-date:
   - `make verify`
   - `make bundle`
   - `make packagemanifests`
   
## Running Tests

### Pre-requisites:
1. Create a namespace with the name `test`
2. Create `jira-service-desk-config` secret in test namespace

### To run tests:
Use the following command to run tests:
`make test OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=test USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true`
